## Example 1: Creating a VM Backup Skill for rh-virt

**User Query**: "Create skill for rh-virt to backup VMs"

**Skill Interaction**:

```
Agentic-Contribution-Skill:
What does it do? For which Red Hat product(s) is this skill targeted?
> "Create VM backups using snapshots for OpenShift Virtualization"

What role uses it?
> "Virt admins"

✅ Detected pack: rh-virt. Use it? (yes/no)
> yes

What MCP tools does this skill need?

Reading rh-virt/mcps.json...

Available MCPs in rh-virt:
- openshift-virtualization (VM management, snapshots)
- openshift-administration (cluster resources, pods, namespaces)

Will you use existing MCPs, need new ones, or both?
> "Use openshift-virtualization: vm-snapshot-create, vm-snapshot-get"

Verifying tools exist in openshift-virtualization MCP...
✅ Verified: virtualmachinesnapshot_create, virtualmachinesnapshot_get exist

Operation type? (read-only/additive/destructive)
> "additive"

Color mapping:
🔵 cyan - Read-only: list VMs, view snapshot status
🟢 green - Additive: create snapshot, create VM, add backup
🔵 blue - Reversible: restart VM, pause snapshot
🟡 yellow - Destructive but recoverable: delete old snapshot
🔴 red - Critical: restore VM from snapshot, delete VM

For "create VM snapshot": green (additive operation)

✅ Color: green

Skill name? (kebab-case)
> "vm-backup-create"

✅ Name is representative of purpose (VM backup using snapshots for OpenShift Virtualization)
✅ Unique in rh-virt

3-5 user phrases for 'Use when':
> - "Backup VM database-01"
> - "Create snapshot before upgrade"
> - "Save VM state for recovery"

NOT for?
> "NOT for restoring (use vm-snapshot-restore)"

Workflow steps with MCP tools:
> 1. Validate VM exists - resources_get
> 2. Check storage supports snapshots - storageclasses_list
> 3. Create snapshot - virtualmachinesnapshot_create
> 4. Monitor until ready - virtualmachinesnapshot_get

3+ common issues:
> "Snapshot fails: Storage doesn't support: Use snapshot-capable storage"
> "VM not found: Wrong namespace: Verify with oc project"
> "Stuck pending: CSI driver issue: Check openshift-storage pods"

## Example 2: Non-representative Name Triggers AI Suggestions

```
Skill name? (kebab-case)
> "check-stuff"

⚠️ Not representative of purpose (monitor cluster health for OpenShift).

Suggestions:
1. cluster-health-monitor
2. ocp-health-check  
3. cluster-metrics-monitor

Choose (1-3) or provide your own:
> 1

✅ Using "cluster-health-monitor"
```

## Example 3: Large Skill Requires docs/ Folder

```
[After Phase 2 - Definition]

Workflow steps:
> 15 steps covering validation, backup, upgrade, monitoring, and rollback

💡 **Modularity Assessment**:
This skill has 15 steps. Options:
1. Single comprehensive skill (recommended for critical/cohesive workflows)
2. Subdivide into 3 modular skills (validation, execution, reporting)

For critical operations like cluster upgrades, option 1 keeps all HITL checkpoints in one place.

Default: Option 1. Subdivide? (yes/no)
> no
