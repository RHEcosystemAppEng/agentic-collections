## Agent

### **remediator** - End-to-End CVE Remediation Orchestration

The remediator agent orchestrates the CVE-related skills to provide complete CVE remediation workflows.

**Use when:**
- "Remediate CVE-2024-1234 on system abc-123"
- "Create and execute a remediation playbook for CVE-X"
- "Patch these 5 CVEs on all production servers"

**Workflow:**
1. **Validate** (cve-validation skill)
2. **Gather Context** (system-context skill)
3. **Generate Playbook** (playbook-generator skill)
4. **Execute** (playbook-executor skill)
5. **Verify** (remediation-verifier skill)

**Capabilities:**
- Single CVE on single system
- Batch remediation (multiple CVEs, multiple systems)
- Cross-environment patching (dev → staging → prod)
- Automated job tracking and reporting
- Partial failure handling

## Skills vs Agent Decision Guide

| User Request | Tool to Use | Reason |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| "Show the managed fleet" | **fleet-inventory skill** | Fleet discovery |
| "What are the critical CVEs?" | **cve-impact skill** | CVE listing |
| "Is CVE-X valid?" | **cve-validation skill** | Single validation |
| "Validate Lightspeed MCP" | **mcp-lightspeed-validator skill** | MCP server validation |
| "Generate execution summary" | **execution-summary skill** | Audit trail reporting |
| "Remediate CVE-2024-1234" | **remediator agent** | Multi-step workflow |
| "Create playbook for CVE-X" | **remediator agent** | Orchestration needed |
| "Was CVE-Y patched?" | **remediation-verifier skill** | Standalone check |

**General Rule**: Skills for information gathering and validation, agent for remediation actions.

## Documentation

The rh-sre pack includes AI-optimized documentation in the `docs/` directory demonstrating advanced documentation patterns:

### Semantic Indexing System

- **Cross-Reference Graph**: Document relationship mapping
- **Token Optimization**: 29% reduction through semantic indexing

### Documentation Categories

- **RHEL**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux administration
- **Ansible**: Automation and playbook development
- **OpenShift**: Container platform operations
- **Lightspeed**: Red Hat Lightspeed platform integration
- **References**: CVSS scoring, security standards

See [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md) for the complete documentation map.

## MCP Server Integrations

The pack integrates with two MCP servers (configured in `.mcp.json`):

### 1. **lightspeed-mcp** - Red Hat Lightspeed Platform
- CVE data and vulnerability management
- System inventory and compliance
- Remediation playbook generation
- Requires: `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID`, `LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET`

**Repository**: https://github.com/redhat/lightspeed-mcp

### 2. **ansible-mcp-server** - Ansible Execution (Mock)
- Playbook execution and job tracking
- Status monitoring (PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED)
- Container-isolated execution
- Volume mount: `/tmp:/playbooks:Z`

**Repository**: https://github.com/dmartinol/mock-ansible-mcp-server

## Sample Workflows

### Workflow 1: Fleet Discovery → CVE Analysis → Remediation

```
User: "Show the managed fleet"
→ fleet-inventory skill lists all systems

User: "What are the critical CVEs affecting these systems?"
→ cve-impact skill analyzes vulnerabilities

User: "Remediate CVE-2024-1234 on all RHEL 8 production systems"
→ remediator agent orchestrates end-to-end remediation
```

### Workflow 2: Emergency CVE Patching

```
User: "URGENT: CVE-2024-CRITICAL has CVSS 9.8 - create emergency
      remediation playbooks for all production systems"
→ remediator agent:
  1. Validates CVE (cve-validation skill)
  2. Lists production systems (system-context skill)
  3. Generates playbook (playbook-generator skill)
  4. Provides execution instructions
  5. Offers automated execution option
```

### Workflow 3: Batch Remediation with Verification

```
User: "Create and execute remediation playbooks for CVE-X, CVE-Y, CVE-Z
      on systems server-01, server-02, server-03"
→ remediator agent:
  1. Validates all CVEs
  2. Gathers system context
  3. Generates consolidated playbook
  4. Asks for execution approval
  5. Executes and monitors job status
  6. Verifies remediation success (remediation-verifier skill)
```

## Security Model

All MCP servers run locally in containers for security:

- **Isolation**: Each MCP server in separate container
- **No Remote Services**: All execution on local machine
- **Credential Handling**: Environment variables only, no persistence
- **Minimal Privileges**: Containers run with minimal required permissions
- **Volume Mounts**: SELinux-labeled (`:Z`) for secure file access

## Configuration

MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightspeed-mcp": {
      "command": "podman",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i",
               "--env", "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID",
               "--env", "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET",
               "quay.io/redhat-services-prod/lightspeed-mcp:latest"],
      "env": {
        "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID": "${LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID}",
        "LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET": "${LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET}"
      }
    },
    "ansible-mcp-server": {
      "command": "podman",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i",
               "-v", "/tmp:/playbooks:Z",
               "quay.io/dmartino/mock-ansible-mcp-server:latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Configuration Notes**:
- Volume mount: `/tmp:/playbooks:Z` (SELinux label required on RHEL/Fedora)
- Playbooks saved to `/tmp` on host → `/playbooks` in container
- Environment variables injected at runtime

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start

**Problem**: Container fails to start or connect

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Podman/Docker running: `podman --version`
2. Check environment variables: `echo $LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID`
3. Test container manually:
   ```bash
   podman run --rm -i --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_ID --env LIGHTSPEED_CLIENT_SECRET \
     ghcr.io/redhat/lightspeed-mcp:latest
   ```

### Authentication Failures

**Problem**: lightspeed-mcp reports authentication errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify service account credentials in Red Hat Console
2. Ensure service account has required RBAC roles:
   - Remediations user
   - Vulnerability viewer
   - Inventory Hosts viewer
3. Regenerate service account secret if expired

### Ansible Playbook Execution Issues

**Problem**: ansible-mcp-server fails to execute playbooks

**Solutions**:
1. Verify container image: `podman pull quay.io/dmartino/mock-ansible-mcp-server:latest`
2. Check playbook exists: `ls -l /tmp/remediation-*.yml`
3. Verify volume mount in `.mcp.json`: Should have `"-v", "/tmp:/playbooks:Z"`
4. Test volume mount:
   ```bash
   echo "test" > /tmp/test.yml
   podman run --rm -v /tmp:/playbooks:Z alpine ls -l /playbooks/test.yml
   ```

### Skills Not Triggering

**Problem**: Skills don't activate on expected queries

**Solutions**:
1. Verify plugin installed: `claude plugin list`
2. Reload Claude Code to refresh plugins
3. Check skill descriptions in `skills/*/SKILL.md`
4. Use explicit phrasing matching skill examples

### Key Patterns
- **Skills encapsulate tools** - Never call MCP tools directly
- **Agents orchestrate skills** - Complex workflows delegate to skills
- **Progressive disclosure** - Load docs incrementally
- **Environment-based secrets** - No hardcoded credentials
